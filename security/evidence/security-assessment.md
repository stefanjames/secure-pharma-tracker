# PharmaChain Security Assessment
## Critical Assets and Attacker Profile Analysis

### CRITICAL ASSETS

#### 1. Pharmaceutical Data Assets
**High Value Targets:**
- **Batch Records**: Manufacturing data, lot numbers, expiry dates, quantities
- **Quality Test Results**: Pass/fail status, test parameters, compliance data
- **Chain of Custody**: Complete tracking from manufacturer to end user
- **Recall Information**: Safety-critical data for public health protection
- **License Data**: FDA registration numbers, manufacturer credentials

**Risk Level**: CRITICAL - Direct impact on patient safety and regulatory compliance

#### 2. Blockchain Infrastructure
**Components:**
- **Smart Contracts**: Immutable batch creation, quality testing, recall logic
- **Private Keys**: Wallet access for authorized operations
- **Transaction History**: Complete audit trail of all operations
- **Contract Addresses**: Deployment locations and access controls

**Risk Level**: HIGH - Compromise could invalidate entire audit trail

#### 3. Database Systems
**Sensitive Data:**
- **PostgreSQL Database**: Batch metadata, user credentials, test results
- **User Authentication**: Role-based access controls (Manufacturer, QA, Regulator, Auditor)
- **Session Management**: Active user sessions and permissions
- **API Keys**: External service integrations

**Risk Level**: HIGH - Contains PII and business-critical data

#### 4. Web Application Layer
**Attack Surfaces:**
- **React Frontend**: User interface, client-side validation
- **Express.js Backend**: API endpoints, business logic
- **Authentication System**: Login, role switching, permission validation
- **File Upload Systems**: QR codes, supporting documents

**Risk Level**: MEDIUM-HIGH - Primary attack vector for most threats

### CRITICAL VULNERABILITIES BY COMPONENT

#### Frontend (React/TypeScript)
- **XSS Attacks**: Unsanitized user input in batch forms
- **CSRF**: State-changing operations without proper tokens
- **Client-Side Security**: Sensitive data exposure in browser
- **Dependency Vulnerabilities**: Outdated npm packages

#### Backend (Express.js/Node.js)
- **SQL Injection**: Database queries with user input
- **Authentication Bypass**: JWT token manipulation
- **Authorization Flaws**: Improper role-based access controls
- **API Security**: Unprotected endpoints, rate limiting gaps

#### Blockchain Layer (Ethereum/Hardhat)
- **Smart Contract Bugs**: Reentrancy, integer overflow
- **Private Key Management**: Insecure key storage
- **Transaction Manipulation**: MEV attacks, front-running
- **Oracle Attacks**: External data source manipulation

#### Database (PostgreSQL)
- **Data Exposure**: Unencrypted sensitive fields
- **Backup Security**: Insecure backup storage
- **Access Controls**: Overprivileged database users
- **Audit Logging**: Insufficient monitoring
