# PharmaChain - Blockchain Supply Chain Tracker

## Overview

PharmaChain is a blockchain-based pharmaceutical supply chain application designed to track products immutably throughout their lifecycle. It integrates a React 18/TypeScript frontend with an Express.js backend and PostgreSQL/Drizzle ORM for data persistence. The core purpose is to provide transparent, auditable tracking capabilities for pharmaceutical products, leveraging Web3 technology for secure and immutable record-keeping. The project aims to enhance supply chain integrity, regulatory compliance, and consumer trust within the pharmaceutical industry.

## User Preferences

Preferred communication style: Simple, everyday language.
Design preference: Modern minimal SaaS interface inspired by ProjectionLab and Cleanvoice aesthetics, featuring clean layouts, lots of white space, subtle gradients, muted color palette, and smooth animations.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture

The frontend uses React 18 and TypeScript with a component-based structure. It leverages Shadcn/ui and Radix UI for components, Tailwind CSS for styling (with a glassmorphism design system), TanStack Query for server state, and Wouter for routing. Forms are handled with React Hook Form and Zod validation. Web3 integration is managed via Ethers.js. The client code resides in a `client/` directory, ensuring clear separation of concerns.

### Backend Architecture

The backend is an Express.js server built with Node.js and TypeScript. It provides RESTful APIs for batch, quality test, and audit log management. Data persistence is handled by PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM, connecting to a Neon serverless database.

### Data Storage Solutions

**Primary Database**: PostgreSQL with Drizzle ORM.
- Tables: `batches`, `qualityTests`, `auditLogs`, `users`.
- Schema: Strongly typed with Zod validation.

**Blockchain Storage**: Smart contracts deployed on a Hardhat local network (Chain ID: 31337).
- Functions: `createBatch`, `addQualityTest`, `updateBatchStatus`, `recallBatch`.
- Immutable records and transaction hashes are stored for audit trails.

### Key Components

- **Web3 Integration**: MetaMask for wallet connection, Ethers.js for type-safe contract interactions. Supports role-based access for different user types (Manufacturers, Distributors, Regulators, Auditors).
- **Batch Management**: Includes creation, status tracking, quality testing integration, and a comprehensive audit trail.
- **User Interface**: Features a modern minimal SaaS design with clean white backgrounds, subtle shadows, rounded corners, and smooth animations. Uses Inter font family with proper typography hierarchy.
- **Data Flow**: Operations typically involve user interaction via MetaMask, simultaneous updates to both blockchain and database, and real-time syncing to the frontend.
- **QR Code Verification System**: Enables mobile-friendly batch verification with QR code generation, download, and an authentication page showing batch status and authenticity.
- **White-Label Branding System**: Supports dynamic theming and branding configurations via CSS variables and environment variables, allowing for multi-tenant deployments.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Implements a comprehensive role system (Manufacturer, QA, Regulator, Auditor) with granular permissions for UI elements, routes, and features.
- **Dashboard KPI Metrics**: Displays real-time data for "Total Batches," "Active Batches," "Pending Tests," and "Quality Tests" using modern SaaS-style cards with gradient icons.
- **Modern Navigation**: Sticky top navigation with centered nav links, profile dropdown, and responsive mobile menu.
- **Component Architecture**: ModernNavbar, ModernHeroSection, ModernStatsCard components implementing the new design system.
- **Color Palette**: Purple primary (#a855f7), clean grays, and status-based colors (green, yellow, red) for batch states.
- **Security Architecture**: Enterprise-grade security middleware with comprehensive header protection, JWT authentication, and IPv6-compatible rate limiting.
- **Blockchain Testing**: Comprehensive comparison framework for UI vs blockchain data validation with transaction analysis and gas cost tracking.
